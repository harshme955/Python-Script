# ðŸ“˜ Python Programs: Factorial & Math Module Calculations

This repository contains two Python programs demonstrating the use of:
- Functions and control structures to calculate a factorial.
- Python's built-in `math` module for mathematical computations.

## âœ… Task 1: Factorial of a Number

### ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument.
2. Calculates the factorial using either a **loop** or **recursion**.
3. Returns the calculated factorial.
4. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

## âœ… Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

### ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Asks the user for a number as input.
2. Uses the `math` module to calculate:
   - Square root of the number
   - Natural logarithm (log base e)
   - Sine of the number (in radians)
3. Displays the calculated results.
